"""Employees can belong to multiple departments

Revision ID: 029
Revises: 028
Create Date: 2026-05-22 00:00:00.000000

Replaces the single `employees.department_id` FK with a many-to-many
`employee_departments` table. Every employee row is migrated into the new
table (1:1), then the legacy column is dropped.

Permission semantics: `*:*:own_dept` is now interpreted as "any department
this user is a member of" — see app/services/permission_engine.py.
